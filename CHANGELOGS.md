Geocaching Maze changelogs
===========================

#### 27/05/2017
 * First test maze added. This could be accessed from ```Main menu > Debug mode```
 * Basic controls added.
 * Maze renderer added. This outputs the current state of the maze into the console. Currently uses letters to correspond maze elements.
 * Maze parser added. This parses the ```Maze``` class into a 2D vector for gameplay. 
 * Added the maze framework. The ```Maze``` class is implented in a way which it'll only require the size of the maze and where the obstacles are instead of hard-coding an array for the maze.
